<!--favorite coffee shops in chi and dmv
chi - dollop coffee, ground up cafe, froth, overflow, starbucks reserve roastery, philz

dmv - esp coffee and treats, misha's, tryst, ebenezer, compass, tatte

6 each

rating - good for studying, hours, proximity/convenience/commute, coffee, food

could start with a map of us with chi and dmv highlighted, put a little coffee cup over them and when you click you go to a page of that city
then when you click it says city as header at the top and then it has the coffee shops as shapes with their logos (or maybe a picture of the coffee shop) inside?? and maybe when you hover it greys out and shows the ratings
